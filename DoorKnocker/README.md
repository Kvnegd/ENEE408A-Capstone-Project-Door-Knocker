******Door Knocker – Smart Knock Detection & Mobile Control System******
Overview

The Door Knocker project is a smart, sensor-driven access interface that detects, localizes, and classifies physical knocks on a door using piezoelectric sensors, embedded signal processing, and a companion mobile application. The system is designed as a low-cost, non-intrusive alternative to traditional keypads or touch-based access systems, leveraging vibration analysis to identify where and how a door is struck.

At its core, the project combines real-time embedded firmware running on a microcontroller with a mobile application that provides configuration, visualization, and user interaction capabilities. Together, these components form a complete knock-based access control and monitoring platform.

Embedded System Architecture

The embedded portion of the project uses multiple piezoelectric knock sensors mounted at different locations on the door. These sensors are sampled simultaneously through synchronized ADC channels, allowing the firmware to capture high-resolution vibration waveforms generated by a knock.

The firmware performs real-time signal processing to extract key features from each knock event, including:

Peak amplitude and signal energy

Relative arrival timing between sensors

Per-sensor response strength

Using these features, the system determines which region of the door was struck and classifies the knock relative to predefined patterns or zones. The design prioritizes:

Robust detection in the presence of noise and structural vibrations

Efficient embedded computation suitable for resource-constrained microcontrollers

Modular firmware structure to support future extensions

The firmware can be extended to trigger actuators (e.g., electronic door locks), communicate with external systems, or log knock events for security analysis.

Mobile Application

The mobile application serves as the primary user interface for the Door Knocker system. It complements the embedded hardware by providing a convenient way to configure, monitor, and interact with the device without requiring direct access to the microcontroller.

Key capabilities of the mobile app include:

System Configuration: Adjust detection thresholds, sensitivity levels, and zone definitions without reflashing firmware.

Visualization: Display real-time or logged knock data, including relative sensor amplitudes and detected zones.

Pattern Management: Define, store, and modify knock sequences used for authentication or identification.

Status Monitoring: View system health, sensor activity, and recent knock events.

Extensibility: Designed to support future features such as user profiles, access logs, or remote notifications.

The app is designed with a clean, intuitive interface that abstracts the underlying signal-processing complexity while still exposing meaningful engineering data for debugging and experimentation.
